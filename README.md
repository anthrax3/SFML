# SFML
Just playing around with SFML. :)  
Requirements to compile:
* Source code
* SFML Library (in /usr/bin/include, or something else for other OS's)
* A Unix machine (Mac or Linux)
* GNU make

Compile it by typing "make" in the directory.  
If it doesnt compile, file it in issues and i'll try to fix it.  

Controls:  
W/A/S/D: Move around  
Left/Right Arrow Keys: Rotate  
PageUp/PageDown: Adjust speed
